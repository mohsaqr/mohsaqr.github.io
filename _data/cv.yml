  type: text
  contents: >
    I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland (UEF), where I also lead UEF's Learning Analytics Unit. Over the past five years, my unit – although small – has been the most productive laboratory in Europe and ranked second worldwide in learning analytics research in 2023. My scholarly impact is reflected in several international accolades, including the Stanford Top 2% Scientist Ranking in 2024 and awards for best papers at LAK 2024, ICCE 2020, SITE 2022, TEEM 2023 and 2024, nominations for ECTEL 2024 and ICALT 2024, and the Europe Emerging Scholar Award in 2023. Notably, I collaborate with over 200 researchers from 30 countries and have consulted for governmental organizations and private enterprises. Additionally, I have participated in the evaluation of the World Academy of Sciences, a UNESCO organization.
