- title: Personal Statement
  type: text
  contents: >
    I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland (UEF), where I also lead UEF's Learning Analytics Unit. Over the past five years, my unit ––– although small ––– has been the most productive laboratory in Europe and ranked second worldwide in learning analytics research in 2023. In the field of learning analytics, I am the third most published author globally, according to Web of Science and Scopus and I have more first-author publications than any other researcher in the field. My work has frequently appeared in prestigious outlets, including Computers and Education, the highest-ranked empirical journal in educational technology, where I have more publications than any other researcher based in Finland. My scholarly impact is reflected in several international accolades, including the Stanford Top 2% Scientist Ranking in 2024 and awards for best papers at LAK 2024, ICCE 2020, SITE 2022, TEEM 2023 and 2024, nominations for ECTEL 2024 and ICALT 2024 and was honored with the Europe Emerging Scholar Award in 2023. My research has secured funding from esteemed organizations, such as the Academy of Finland (as Principal Investigator) and the Swedish Research Council (as Co-Principal Investigator). I serve on the editorial boards of six prominent journals, including the British Journal of Educational Technology, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, and PLOS ONE. I have also chaired several conference tracks, been invited for over 20 keynotes and guest lectures, and contributed to special issues as an editor. Notably, I collaborate with over 200 researchers from 30 countries and have consulted for governmental organizations and private enterprises. Additionally, I have participated in the evaluation of the World Academy of Sciences, a UNESCO organization.
