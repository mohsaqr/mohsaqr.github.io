TNA package released and available for download. The package provides tools for performing Transition Network Analysis (TNA) to study relational dynamics, including functions for building and plotting TNA models, calculating centrality measures, and identifying dominant events and patterns. TNA statistical techniques (e.g., bootstrapping and permutation tests) ensure the reliability of observed insights and confirm that identified dynamics are meaningful. See (Saqr et al., 2024) <\[doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.15486]\(https://doi.org/10.48550%2FarXiv.2411.15486)> for more details on TNA.
