If you have a research idea, are interested in collaborating, or are considering a funding proposal, feel free to get in touch. We welcome research mobilities and internships at our unit for those interested in visiting us, working on related research, contributing to our projects, or learning about learning analytics, artificial intelligence, or network analysis. If you are looking to gain experience, please reach out. We have hosted researchers and interns from France, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Finland, Egypt, and the Netherlands, to mention a few.

I also welcome the opportunity to supervise PhD and Master's students. If you are a Master's degree student, please reach out or pass by my office, though it is best to coordinate a meeting by email first. For PhD students, I do not have open positions at the moment but am open to self-funded opportunities, industry PhDs, or other collaborative projects. It is best if you review my publications profile to get acquainted with my work. While I am not strictly tied to my current research, I stay within the limits of my expertise. If in doubt, send me an email and let's have a chat.

I am also open to giving talks, keynotes, and workshops related to my research and expertise; the earlier you get in touch, the better, so I can organize my duties and commitments. You can contact me via e-mail at **mohammed.saqr@uef.fi**. I look forward to connecting with you!
