If you have a research idea, are interested in collaborating, or are considering a funding proposal, feel free to get in touch. In addition, I am open to research mobility opportunities and internships for students interested in working on research related to ours, contributing to our projects or learn about learning analytics,  Artificial intelligence or network analysis. If you are looking to gain experience or contribute to ongoing research, please reach out. We have hosted researchers and interns from France, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Finland, Egypt and the Netherlands, to mention a few.

I also welcome the opportunity to supervise PhD and Master's students. If you are a master degree student, please reach out or pass by my office. Better to coordinate a meeting by email first.
For PhD students, I donâ€™t have open positions at the moment, but I am open to self-funded opportunities, industry PhDs, or other collaborative projects. Best if you look at my publicaitons profile and get acquainted with what I work on. I am not strictly tied to my current work but of course, I stay within the limits of my expertise and what I can supervise. If in doubt send me an email and let's have a chat.

I am also open for talks, keynotes, and workshops if they are realted to my research or expertise, the earlier the better so that I can organize my duties and commitments.
You can contact me via e-mail at mohammed.saqr@uef.fi. Looking forward to connecting with you!
