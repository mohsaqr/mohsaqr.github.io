# Interests

My research interests are interdisciplinary, focusing on the intersection of analytics, novel methods, open science, and education. A central theme of my work is **idiographic analytics**, which aims to derive insights from individual data to generate personalized recommendations. This approach is key to understanding **individual differences** in learning and behavior, allowing for the creation of tailored solutions while addressing privacy and ethical concerns. I explore how these individual differences influence learning processes and outcomes, particularly in the context of engagement and collaborative environments. Additionally, I draw on the power of big data and artificial intelligence to unlock new insights and push the boundaries of methodological advances.

Beyond idiographic approaches, I also investigate the **temporality**, **heterogeneity**, and dynamics of learning, aiming to create personalized, equitable, and unbiased science. My work spans a wide range of methods, such as machine learning, mixture models, network science, sequence analysis, process mining, Markov models, psychological networks, temporal networks, meta-analysis, topic modeling, and scientometrics. Below, I summarize the main themes of my research:

### Network Analysis in Education
A significant area of my research focuses on networks and network analysis. I have published on networks in collaborative learning, problem-based learning, language learning, and computer science education. I have explored optimal methods for network analysis, conducted large-scale empirical studies on centrality measures, and performed meta-analyses to identify which centrality measures predict student achievement. My work also includes interventions based on network analysis, modeling knowledge diffusion and social contagion, analyzing conflict and robustness in networks, and studying group influence on collaborative dynamics. I have contributed to best practices in network analysis and outlined future research directions and challenges.

### Temporal Networks
Temporal networks represent a new and exciting paradigm in education. I am particularly interested in how temporal networks can model the relational dynamics of time. My research includes publications on the principles of temporal networks in education, their potential to predict student performance early, and their ability to reveal the dynamics of collaborative learning across various platforms. My most recent work explores the role of temporal networks in collaborative learning, temporal network centralities, and pathways of knowledge construction.

### Psychological Networks
The introduction of **psychological networks** has made it possible to model the complexity of human behavior more effectively. I am working with psychological networks to understand self-regulated learning (SRL) in both language learning and collaborative learning contexts. My research also focuses on modeling the interplay between SRL monitoring events and mapping idiographic processes. Through idiographic analytics, I aim to personalize insights based on individual data, offering personalized recommendations while maintaining ethical standards.

### Longitudinal Research
Longitudinal studies provide valuable insights into how behavior evolves over time. Although rare and resource-intensive, I have applied longitudinal methods to large datasets spanning entire educational programs. My studies include exploring the longitudinal trajectories of student engagement, examining how engagement develops over four years and the effects of early disengagement. I have also studied the evolution of collaborative roles over time and the transfer of successful learning strategies across different courses within a program.

### Learning Analytics and Quantitative Research
Learning analytics is a core area of my work, where I strive to improve predictive models of student performance. I have applied single-paper meta-analysis to identify reliable performance predictors and have investigated the impact of individual differences on the accuracy of predictive models. My research also includes sequence mining, multi-channel sequence mining, and Hidden Markov Models. Additionally, I use person-centered methods such as latent class analysis and clustering. In terms of temporal methods, I have worked with process mining techniques, including frequency-based process mining and first-order Markov models. I have also employed Graphical Gaussian models and epistemic network analysis to understand student strategies.

### Scientometrics and Bibliometrics
My interest in networks, visualization, and scholarly practices has led me to explore **scientometrics** and **bibliometrics**. I have mapped research landscapes in areas such as computational thinking, educational technology, the Koli Calling conference, and multiple sclerosis. This work has inspired an upcoming book on computer science education research. I also study **altmetrics**, which analyze the publicâ€™s engagement with academic papers via social media, offering new ways to assess the broader impact of research.
