My research is dedicated to advancing Precision XAI (Explainable Precise AI) systems that accurately model individuals to deliver person-specific insights and recommendations with unprecedented granularity. This work prioritizes equity, transparency, and inclusivity while leveraging unobtrusive multimodal data and advanced analytical methods. Through the development of AutoML techniques and person-specific models, we aim to eliminate bias and unfairness by building adaptive solutions grounded in individual data. While the primary focus is on educational applications, the implications extend to well-being, mental health, and other domains of societal significance. The scalability of these XAI solutions ensures global impact potential, capable of improving quality of life for millions through mobile, person-specific AI applications.

Building on our state-of-the-art Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) methodology, my research explores the complex dynamics of human-human, human-AI, and AI-AI interactions to uncover behavioral patterns and processes. This work addresses the tension between AI-enhanced learning and the risks of passive consumption by promoting human-centric AI that prioritizes growth, equity, and higher-order cognitive skills. The goal is to develop adaptive AI systems that support co-creative processes, critical thinking, and innovation while mitigating risks of dependency.

In the broader context, my interests are interdisciplinary, situated at the intersection of analytics, novel methods, open science, and education. I explore temporality, individual differences, and heterogeneity as an overarching analytical framework for personalized, equitable, and debiasing science. My methodological toolkit includes machine learning, mixture models, network science, sequence analysis, process mining, Markov models, psychological networks, temporal networks, meta-analyses, topic modeling, and scientometrics.

In the grand scheme of things, my interests are interdisciplinary at the intersection of analytics, novel methods, open science and education. My focus is to push the boundaries of methodological advances and unlock the power of big data to bring new insights. In so doing, I explore the temporality, individual differences and heterogeneity as an overarching analytical framework for personalized, equitable and debiasing science. As such, I worked with machine learning, mixture models, network science, sequence analysis, process mining, Markov models, psychological networks, temporal networks, meta-analyses, topic modelling and scientometrics. The main themes of my research can be summarized in the following:


### Network Analysis in Education
One of my main areas of research centers around [networks and network analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9734010). I published about networks in [collaborative learning](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1126-1), in [problem-based learning](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1599-6), in [language learning](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.13187) and in [computer science](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16290-9_55) education. I also worked on finding [best methods](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11412-020-09322-6) for network analysis, performed a [large scale empirical investigation](https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/7415) of centrality measures and did a [meta-analysis on centralities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X22000069) to find out which measures capture students' achievement. Other threads of network research include [intervention](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194777) based on network analysis, modeling [diffusion and social contagion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11412-021-09356-4) of knowledge, modeling [conflict and robustness](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71483-z) in networks and [group influence](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29736-7_35) on collaborative dynamics and [success factors](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-020-01997-7). I also contributed to [guidelines](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2868/article_7.pdf) on best practices in network analysis, [finding future agendas](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2868/article_1.pdf), and [addressing the challenges](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3258/xpreface.pdf) that face network analysis in education.

### Temporal Networks
**Temporal networks** are a new paradigm in general and have been recently introduced to education. Currently, temporal networks are I am passionate about the different possibilities that temporal networks could bring to modeling the relational time dynamics. I published about the [basic principles](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3258/article_4.pdf) of temporal networks in education. How temporal networks can [early predict students' performance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3375462.3375501) and how network analysis can help [reveal the dynamics](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16290-9_55) of collaborative learning across different learning platforms. [My latest work explores the affordances](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.13187) of temporal networks in collaborative learning, the temporal network centralities and the pathways of knowledge construction.

### Complex systems
Modeling the complexity of human behavior has always been challenging. The recent introduction of **psychological networks** has made it possible to model the complexity of human behavior. Recently, I started working with psychological networks to understand [how self-regulated process works](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343657926_Applying_Learning_Analytics_to_Map_Students'_Self-Regulated_Learning_Tactics_in_an_Academic_Writing_Course) in language learning, how [self-regulated unfolds in collaborative learning](https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/7429) and to model the [complex interplay](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08076-0_4) between SRL monitoring events as well as to [map idiographic processes](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2868/article_4.pdf). **Idiographic analytics** seeks to derive insights from individual persons and deliver recommendations based on their own data, and therefore, one can have a [single person study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499920). Having idiographic analytics would have [several privacy and ethical constraints resolved](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sonsoles-Lopez-Pernas/publication/350886273_Idiographic_Learning_Analytics_A_Within-Person_Ethical_Perspective/links/607839718ea909241efea6f5/Idiographic-Learning-Analytics-A-Within-Person-Ethical-Perspective.pdf).

### Temporal methods
**Longitudinal research** is rare, exhaustive and requires advanced methods. However, there is much to learn from how behavior unfolds in time. I have tackled several of these challenges using very large datasets that span a whole program. I explored the longitudinal trajectories of engagement to show how [engagement unfolds over four years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521002025) and [the consequences of early disengagement](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86436-1_10). I also studied how [collaborative roles emerge, persist, transition or evolve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013152200152X) over time in a massive study over four years. I also investigated the evolution of learning strategies and the [transfer of successful strategies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2022.100902) across courses over a full program.

Learning analytics and quantitative **research methods** in general are on top of my mind and work. I worked on improving [predictive learning analytics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0142159X.2017.1309376), applied single-paper [meta-analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2022.2061450) to study which predictors capture students' performance reliably and consistently. I also studied the [effect of individual differences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521001287) on accuracy of predictive models. I also used [sequence mining](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/9/4825) in several studies, [multi-channel sequence mining](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9646931) and Hidden Markov [Models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521002025), Mixed-Hidden Markov [models](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12525). I also used several [person-centered](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.866612/full) methods including [latent class analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-10980-2), [latent profile analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131521002025) and [clustering](https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/using-diffusion-network-analytics-to-examine-and-support-knowled/18352068). Relevant to the temporal methods are the process mining techniques which includes [frequency based process mining](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.840178/full) and First-order Markov [Models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343657926_Applying_Learning_Analytics_to_Map_Students'_Self-Regulated_Learning_Tactics_in_an_Academic_Writing_Course). I have also used [Graphical Gaussian models](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2828/article_2.pdf) and [epistemic network analysis](https://telrp.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41039-021-00175-7) in mapping students strategies.

### Learning Analytics and Quantitative Research
Learning analytics is a core area of my work, where I strive to improve predictive models of student performance. I have applied single-paper meta-analysis to identify reliable performance predictors and have investigated the impact of individual differences on the accuracy of predictive models. My research also includes sequence mining, multi-channel sequence mining, and Hidden Markov Models. Additionally, I use person-centered methods such as latent class analysis and clustering. In terms of temporal methods, I have worked with process mining techniques, including frequency-based process mining and first-order Markov models. I have also employed Graphical Gaussian models and epistemic network analysis to understand student strategies.

### Scientometrics and Bibliometrics
My love for networks, visualization and scholarly practices have amounted to a new passion for [scientometric](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4156916) and [bibliometric](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35280299/) studies. I mapped the landscape of research on e.g., [computational thinking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347583738_People_Ideas_Milestones_A_Scientometric_Study_of_Computational_Thinking), [games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353603501_Two_decades_of_game_concepts_in_digital_learning_environments_-_A_bibliometric_study_and_research_agenda), [education technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563221004465), [Koli calling conference](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Koli-Callings-evolution-towards-an-international-venue_fig3_361467430) and [multiple sclerosis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.845539/full). Such work has opened the doors for a whole new [book](https://cerbook.org/) coming soon on computer science education research. Altmetrics is closely related to bibliometrics research, where one can see how the public has embraced, discussed or debated a paper. In this [paper](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1834232/v1/7ade3570-6fed-40c2-a603-f0bb51bc6455.pdf?c=1657730081), I look at the the entire field of computer science education research across social media.
