**Learning analytics** &mdash; the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts &mdash; is the integrating thread across all my research. From the earliest work on predicting underachieving medical students through their online activity traces, I have been interested in what educational data can reliably tell us about learning, and what it cannot.

A persistent theme is the tension between prediction and explanation. My research has shown that early prediction of at-risk students is feasible using engagement indicators from learning management systems, but that the accuracy and the predictors themselves vary substantially across courses and individuals. Through single-paper meta-analyses pooling results across many courses, I have identified which variables capture student performance reliably and consistently, and where individual differences undermine cross-context generalization. This has led to a deeper engagement with person-centered methods &mdash; latent class analysis, latent profile analysis, clustering, and mixture models &mdash; that respect heterogeneity rather than averaging it away. I have also contributed methodological tutorials on structural equation modeling, epistemic network analysis, and the broader learning analytics pipeline, aiming to make these techniques accessible and reproducible for educational researchers worldwide.
