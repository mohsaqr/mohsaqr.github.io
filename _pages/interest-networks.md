Networks are a powerful lens for understanding learning as a relational phenomenon. Rather than treating students as isolated entities, **network analysis** reveals how learners connect, exchange information, and build social capital through their interactions. My work in this area spans collaborative learning networks in medical education, problem-based learning, language learning, and computer science education &mdash; consistently demonstrating that a student's position in the network carries meaningful signals about their engagement, knowledge construction, and academic outcomes.

A central thread of this research concerns methodological rigor: which centrality measures reliably capture students' participation and social dimensions, which network configurations yield reproducible results, and how diffusion-based centralities can capture information exchange processes at scale. Through a series of large-scale empirical studies and meta-analyses, I have established that network parameters can serve as early-warning indicators of academic performance. Other threads include modeling network robustness and rich-club phenomena, studying how social capital and long-term ties influence learning, and developing guidelines for best practices in educational network analysis.
