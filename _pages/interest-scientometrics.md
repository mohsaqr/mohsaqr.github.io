My interests in networks, visualization, and scholarly practices converge in a sustained program of **scientometric and bibliometric research**. By applying network analysis, topic modeling, and quantitative methods to large bibliographic datasets, I map the intellectual landscape of entire research fields &mdash; identifying foundational works, emerging themes, collaboration structures, and gaps that point toward future directions.

A major thread of this work focuses on computing education research, where I have mapped the evolution of computational thinking as a research topic, traced the 50-year trajectory of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, and compiled the first comprehensive scientometric overview of CER as a field. Beyond computing, I have applied these methods to education technology in legal education, serious games, and multiple sclerosis research. A distinctive contribution is the study of altmetrics &mdash; how research is discussed, shared, and debated on social media, blogs, and news outlets &mdash; revealing that public impact often diverges sharply from traditional citation metrics. This body of work has informed an entire book on computer science education research and continues to open new avenues for understanding how knowledge is produced, disseminated, and received.
