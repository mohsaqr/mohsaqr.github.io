### **Teaching philosophy**

I believe that learning should be adaptive, student-centered and responsive to the needs and expectations of the learners. I aspire to create an inclusive classroom that facilitates creativity, critical thinking, reflection and collaboration. Supported by technologies that I use to build my teaching, enable collaborative activities and streamline communications. Technology-enhanced learning helps me to monitor students’ learning,  offer timely and responsive support and enrich my resources. Having vast experience in learning analytics compliments my understanding of students’ regulation of learning and online behavior. But I am not blinded by the data and analytics, for me, learning is deeply social, interactive and requires compassion and understanding of the socio-cultural aspects that data might not tell.

I always try to create a stimulating environment where students can gain current knowledge and skills, as well as the life-long learning skills that help in future careers. In my courses. I give detailed individualized constructive feedback on every assignment to every student, and I also encourage students to give me continuous feedback on all course items which I carefully listen to and adjust. To achieve these goals, I use best research-based practices based on scientific evidence and expert guidelines. My teaching resources include diverse methods that include authoritative literature, multimedia rich slides, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration tools, and communication tools. Since my courses include practical and hands-on activities, there are always external tools that are relevant to the course content and most importantly, to their professional careers.

I use assignments (**No final exams**), practical exercises, projects, and critical literature review assignments to assess my students. Since collaborative learning (and group based work) is an essential part of my courses, I use social network analysis, group performance, and individual students assessment to give a fair estimation of students' contribution to group work. I use exams less often, as I believe that assessment should mimic life and career scenarios.

### **Feedback**

**A a sample of students feedback** `“It really amazes me how much weight our opinion (the student's) matters in this course and how much impact it is going to have for the next iterations of the course! Everything so far has been an amazing experience, congratulations for this professor, and I am sure in the future the course is going to be even more exciting with the valuable input we all gave!”`

**Another  a sample of students feedback** `“The support and understanding from the lecturer was really motivating and helped boost my morale especially during this pandemic. The facilitation for a number of international guest lectures and the practical sessions were very helpful in understanding more about the course and am currently thinking of writing my masters thesis in relation to learning analytics field”`
