Recently, students have become networked in many ways, and evidence is mounting that networking plays a significant role in how students learn, interact, and transfer information. Relationships could translate to opportunities; resources and support that help achieve the pursued goals and objectives. Although students exist, interact, and play different roles within social and information networks, networks have not received the due attention. This research aimed to study medical student’s friendship- and information exchange networks as well as assess the correlation between social capital and network position variables and the cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) which is the average grade obtained over all the years. The relationships considered in our study are the long-term face-to-face and online ties that developed over the full duration of the study in the medical college. More specifically, we have studied face-to-face and information networks. Analysis of student’s networks included a combination of visual and social network analysis. The correlation with the performance was performed using resampling permutation correlation coefficient, linear regression, and 10-fold cross-validation of binary logistic regression. The results of correlation and linear regression tests demonstrated that student’s social capital was correlated with performance. The most significant factors were the power of close friends regarding connectedness and achievement scores. These findings were evident in the close friends’ network and the information network. The results of this study highlight the importance of social capital and networking ties in medical schools and the need to consider peer dynamics in class assignment and support services. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
