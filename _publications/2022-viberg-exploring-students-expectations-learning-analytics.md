In order to successfully implement learning analytics (LA), we need a better understanding of student expectations of such services. Yet, there is still a limited body of research about students’ expectations across countries. Student expectations of LA have been predominantly examined from a view that perceives students as a group of individuals representing homogenous views. This study examines students’ ideal (i.e., representing their wanted outcomes) and predicted expectations (i.e., unveiling what they realistically expect the LA service is most likely to be) of LA by employing a person-centered approach that allows exploring the heterogeneity that may be found in student expectations. We collected data from 132 students in the setting of Swedish higher education by means of an online survey. Descriptive statistics and Latent Class Analysis (LCA) were used for the analysis. Our findings show that students’ ideal expectations of LA were considerably higher compared to their predicted expectations. The results of the LCA exhibit that the Swedish students’ expectations of LA were heterogeneous, both regarding their privacy concerns and their expectations of LA services. The findings of this study can be seen as a baseline of students’ expectations or a cross-sectional average, and be used to inform student-centered implementation of LA in higher education. © 2022, The Author(s).
