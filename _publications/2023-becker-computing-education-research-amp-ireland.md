In 1970, SIGCSE had five members from England, Scotland and Wales. By 1983 Ireland had a member, followed by Northern Ireland in 1995. Well before then researchers from these countries had contributed to the growing CER community. In 1998 the 3rd ACM ITiCSE conference was held in Ireland. Since then researchers in these countries have contributed to advancing CER regionally and globally, hosting numerous ITiCSE and ICER conferences and spawning several influential research projects and groups. In the last decade two ACM SIGCSE Chapters (UK, and Ireland) were established along with two annual conferences: Computing Education Practice (CEP), and the UK & Ireland Computing Education Research conference (UKICER) now in their 7th and 4th years. In 2022 ITiCSE returned to Ireland. This chapter describes more than 50 years of history and growth of CER within, and to come out of, the UK and Ireland, along with a scientometric study of research outputs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.
