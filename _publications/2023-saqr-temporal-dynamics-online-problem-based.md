Early research on online PBL explored student satisfaction, effectiveness, and design. The temporal aspect of online PBL has rarely been addressed. Thus, a gap exists in our knowledge regarding how online PBL unfolds: when and for how long a group engages in collaborative discussions. Similarly, little is known about whether and what sequence of interactions could predict higher achievement. This study aims to bridge such a gap by implementing the latest advances in temporal learning analytics to analyze the sequential and temporal aspects of online PBL across a large sample (n = 204 students) of qualitatively coded interactions (8,009 interactions). We analyzed interactions at the group level to understand the group dynamics across whole problem discussions, and at the student level to understand the students’ contribution dynamics across different episodes. We followed such analyses by examining the association of interaction types and the sequences thereof with students’ performance using multilevel linear regression models. The analysis of the interactions reflected that the scripted PBL process is followed a logical sequence, yet often lacked enough depth. When cognitive interactions (e.g., arguments, questions, and evaluations) occurred, they kindled high cognitive interactions, when low cognitive and social interactions dominated, they kindled low cognitive interactions. The order and sequence of interactions were more predictive of performance, and with a higher explanatory power as compared to frequencies. Starting or initiating interactions (even with low cognitive content) showed the highest association with performance, pointing to the importance of initiative and sequencing. © 2023, The Author(s).
