In this chapter, we present the main types of data that are used in learning analytics research. Learning analytics has grown to encompass the digital trails left by online learning technologies-clicks, events, and interactions-, sensor data and self-reports among others. We present a collection of curated real-life open datasets that represent the most common types of educational data. The datasets have been collected from diverse sources such as learning management systems, online forums, and surveys. These datasets are used throughout the book to illustrate methods of analysis such as sequence analysis, social network analysis, Markov models, predictive analytics and structure equation modeling, to mention a few. Each data set in the chapter is presented with its context, main properties, links to the original source, as well as a brief exploratory data analysis. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2024. This book is an open access publication.
