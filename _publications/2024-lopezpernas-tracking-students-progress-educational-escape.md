Learning analytics dashboards are the main vehicle for providing educators with a visual representation of data and insights related to teaching and learning. Recent research has found that the data visualizations provided by dashboards are often very basic and do not take advantage of the latest research advances to analyze and depict the learning process. In this article, we present a success story of how we adapted a visualization used for research purposes for its integration in a dashboard for its use by teachers in daily practice. Specifically, we described the process of transforming and integrating a static sequence analysis visualization into an interactive web visualization in a learning analytics dashboard for monitoring students’ temporal trajectories in educational escape rooms in real time. We interviewed teachers to find out how they made use of the dashboard and present a qualitative content analysis of their responses. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
