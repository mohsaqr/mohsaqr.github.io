With a growing emphasis on accessibility in design, incorporating AI into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education equips students with the skills to develop inclusive and accessible user interfaces (UI). This study examines the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student learning of UI design in an HCI course. The study involves 42 students who participated in a UI design project divided into nine teams. Initially, students worked without the AI tool in their pre-UI design phase and later improved their post-designs based on the AI tool's suggestions. The study employed qualitative analysis using thematic analysis to explore the student experience of using AI tools in the design project. Our findings revealed that students valued the AI tools as design element and requirements reminders and suggestion providers to design accessible UIs. The AI tools also provided students with accessibility and usability awareness, aiding in creating professional and inclusive UIs. However, the study also identified challenges, including concerns about the accuracy of user questions and AI responses, variability in AI tool suggestions, a knowledge gap regarding AI tools, and difficulty in selecting implementable design suggestions. Our study highlights the potential of AI to enhance accessibility in UI design and promote a more user-centered approach while suggesting future research directions for the use of AI tools in software design and development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.
