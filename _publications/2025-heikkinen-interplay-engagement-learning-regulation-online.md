This study is of significant importance as it examines the interplay between student engagement and self-regulated learning (SRL) in online learning environments. We analyse longitudinal data comprising student survey responses and log files from a learning management system (LMS). The participants were 165 students enrolled in a Finnish higher education institution course. Data collection included trace data from the LMS, detailing each student's actions with timestamps, and survey data collected at multiple points throughout the course. Students were classified based on their engagement patterns and self-regulation abilities. We utilised clustering methods to group students into engagement and SRL clusters. The findings, which are of great relevance, indicate a positive association between student engagement and SRL, suggesting that enhancing SRL skills can lead to improved student engagement and academic performance. The study, therefore, underscores the need to develop effective learning strategies and interventions that support students’ self-regulation and engagement in online courses. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.
