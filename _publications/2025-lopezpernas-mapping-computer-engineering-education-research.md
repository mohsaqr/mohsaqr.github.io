In this article, we applied structural topic modeling to identify the themes of computer engineering education research using bibliometric metadata. Our findings reveal that research mainly focuses on subjects that are not unique to computer engineering education and that there is increasing attention to learning analytics and psychological research. © 1970-2012 IEEE.
