Traditional methods in educational research often fail to capture the complex and evolving nature of learning processes. This chapter examines the use of complex systems theory in education to address these limitations. The chapter covers the main characteristics of complex systems such as non-linear relationships, emergent properties, and feedback mechanisms to explain how educational phenomena unfold. Some of the main methodological approaches are presented, such as network analysis and recurrence quantification analysis to study relationships and patterns in learning. These have been operationalized by existing education research to study self-regulation, engagement, and academic emotions, among other learning-related constructs. Lastly, the chapter describes data collection methods that are suitable for studying learning processes from a complex systems’ perspective. © 2026 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).
