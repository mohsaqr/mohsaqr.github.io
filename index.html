Institutions and countries alike are racing to harness the power of using data to support students, teachers and stakeholders. Research in the field has proven that predicting and supporting underachieving students is worthwhile. Nonetheless, challenges remain unresolved, for example, lack of generalizability, portability and failure to advance our understanding of students’ behaviour. Recently, interest has grown in modelling individual or within-person behaviour, that is, understanding the person-specific changes. This study applies a novel method that combines within-person with between-person variance to better understand how changes unfolding at the individual level can explain students’ final grades. By modelling the within-person variance, we directly model where the process takes place, that is the student. Our study finds that combining within- and between-person variance offers a better explanatory power and a better guidance of the variables that could be targeted for intervention at the personal and group levels. Furthermore, using within-person variance opens the door for person-specific idiographic models that work on individual student data and offer students support based on their own insights. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Predicting students’ performance has commonly been implemented using cross-sectional data at the group level. Predictive models help predict and explain student performance in individual courses but are hard to generalize. Heterogeneity has been a major factor in hindering cross-course or context generalization. What this paper adds Intra-individual (within-person) variations can be modelled using repeated measures data. Hybrid between–within-person models offer more explanatory and predictive power of students’ performance. Intra-individual variations do not mirror interindividual variations, and thus, generalization is not warranted. Regularity is a robust predictor of student performance at both the individual and the group levels. Implications for practice The study offers a method for teachers to better understand and predict students’ performance. The study offers a method of identifying what works on a group or personal level. Intervention at the personal level can be more effective when using within-person predictors and at the group level when using between-person predictors. © 2023 The Authors.

Our study intends to add to this emerging body of research by analyzing the longitudinal trajectories of interaction between student engagement and achievement over a full four-year program. We use learning analytics and life-course methods to study how achievement and engagement are intertwined and how such relationship evolves over a full program for 106 students. Our findings have indicated that the association between engagement and achievement varies between students and progresses differently between such groups over time. Our results showed that online engagement at any single time-point is not a consistent indicator for high achievement. It takes more than a single point of time to reliably forecast high achievement throughout the program. Longitudinal high grades, or longitudinal high levels of engagement (either separately or combined) were indicators of a stable academic trajectory in which students remained engaged —at least on average— and had a higher level of achievement. On the other hand, disengagement at any time point was consistently associated with lower achievement among low-engaged students. Improving to a higher level of engagement was associated with —at least— acceptable achievement levels and rare dropouts. Lack of improvement or “catching up” may be a more ominous sign that should be proactively addressed. © 2023 The Authors</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Saqr2028" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How CSCL roles emerge, persist, transition, and evolve over time: A four-year longitudinal study</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Saqr, and Sonsoles López-Pernas </div> <div class="periodical"> 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104581" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A prevailing trend in CSCL literature has been the study of students’ participatory roles. The majority of existing studies examine a single collaborative task or, at most, a complete course. This study aims to investigate the presence —or the lack thereof— of a more enduring disposition that drives student participation patterns across courses. Based on data from a 4-year program where 329 students used CSCL to collaborate in 10 successive courses (amounting up to 84,597 interactions), we identify the emerging roles using centrality measures and latent profile analysis (LPA) and trace the unfolding of roles over the entire duration of the program. Thereafter, we use Mixture Hidden Markov Models (MHMM) —methods that are particularly useful in detecting “latent traits” in longitudinal data— to identify how students’ roles, transition, persist or evolve over time. Relevant covariates were also examined to explain students’ membership of different trajectories. We identified three different roles (leader, mediator, isolate) at the course level. At the program level, we found three distinct trajectories: an intense trajectory with mostly leaders, a fluctuating trajectory with mostly mediators, and a wallowing-in-the-mire trajectory with mostly isolates. Our results show that roles re-emerge consistently regardless of the task or the course over extended periods of time and in a predictable manner. For instance, isolates “assumed” such a role in almost all of their courses over four years. © 2022 The Authors</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Saqr2029" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Group-level analysis of engagement poorly reflects individual students’ processes: Why we need idiographic learning analytics</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Saqr </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.107991" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A central assumption of the scientific method is that inferences derived from group-level analysis align with and generalize to the individual level. This study was conducted to put this assumption to the test to examine if and to what extent our analysis, inferences, and assumptions hold, and which variables generalize from the group to the individual level. We use engagement as the underpinning of this study. However, the same methods and questions apply elsewhere. The study included 238 students over six courses and applied the latest advances in psychological networks. Two networks were estimated using the same data: a between-person model that captures the group-level engagement and a within-person model that captures the within-person processes. The results showed that there were significant differences between the two networks and a lack of generalizability regarding regularity, academic achievement, and online disengagement. Such findings cast doubts on inferences drawn from group-level data about our understanding of learners’ performance or engagement, or to design personalized interventions. More attention and efforts are needed to further model within-person processes to understand, and possibly deliver precise personalized support and interventions that are more generalizable and truly personalized. © 2023 The Author</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Saqr2031" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">When, how and for whom changes in engagement happen: A transition analysis of instructional variables</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Saqr, Sonsoles López-Pernas, and Leonie V.D.E.

Our study addresses such a gap and investigates how engagement evolves or changes over time, using a person-centered approach to identify for whom the changes happen and when. We take advantage of a novel and innovative multistate Markov model to identify what variables influence such transitions and with what magnitude, i.e., to answer the why. We use a large data set of 1428 enrollments in six courses (238 students). The findings show that online engagement changes differently —across students— and at different magnitudes —according to different instructional variables and previous engagement states. Cognitively engaging instructions helped cognitively engaged students stay engaged while negatively affecting disengaged students. Lectures —a resource that requires less mental energy— helped improve disengaged students. Such differential effects point to the different ways interventions can be applied to different groups, and how different groups may be supported. A balanced, carefully tailored approach is needed to design, intervene, or support students’ engagement that takes into account the diversity of engagement states as well as the varied response magnitudes that intervention may incur across diverse students’ profiles. © 2023 The Authors</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Saqr2034" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The longitudinal trajectories of online engagement over a full program</div> <div class="author"> Mohammed Saqr, and Sonsoles López-Pernas </div> <div class="periodical"> 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104325" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Student engagement has a trajectory (a timeline) that unfolds over time and can be shaped by different factors including learners’ motivation, school conditions, and the nature of learning tasks. Such factors may result in either a stable, declining or fluctuating engagement trajectory. While research on online engagement is abundant, most authors have examined student engagement in a single course or two. Little research has been devoted to studying online longitudinal engagement, i.e., the evolution of student engagement over a full educational program. This learning analytics study examines the engagement states (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions) of 106 students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data of students enrolled in the academic year 2014–2015, and their subsequent data in 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 (15 courses) were collected. The engagement states were clustered using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement trajectories which resulted in a mostly-engaged (33% of students), an intermediate (39.6%), and a troubled (27.4%) trajectory. The mostly-engaged trajectory was stable with infrequent changes, scored the highest, and was less likely to drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early disengagement, frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The results of our study show how to identify early program disengagement (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop out (first year and early second year). © 2021 The Author(s)</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Jovanović2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Students matter the most in learning analytics: The effects of internal and instructional conditions in predicting academic success</div> <div class="author"> Jelena Jovanović, Mohammed Saqr, Srećko Joksimović, and Dragan Gašević </div> <div class="periodical"> 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> All Open Access, Green Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104251" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Predictive modelling of academic success and retention has been a key research theme in Learning Analytics. While the initial work on predictive modelling was focused on the development of general predictive models, portable across different learning settings, later studies demonstrated the drawbacks of not considering the specificities of course design and disciplinary context. This study builds on the methods and findings of related earlier studies to further explore factors predictive of learners’ academic success in blended learning. In doing so, it differentiates itself by (i) relying on a larger and homogeneous course sample (15 courses, 50 course offerings in total), and (ii) considering both internal and external conditions as factors affecting the learning process. We apply mixed effect linear regression models, to examine: i) to what extent indicators of students’ online learning behaviour can explain the variability in the final grades, and ii) to what extent that variability is attributable to the course and students’ internal conditions, not captured by the logged data. Having examined different types of behaviour indicators (e.g., indicators of the overall activity level, those indicative of regularity of study, etc), we found little difference, if any, in their predictive power. Our results further indicate that a low proportion of variance is explained by the behaviour-based indicators, while a significant portion of variability stems from the learners’ internal conditions. Hence, when variability in external conditions is largely controlled for (the same institution, discipline, and nominal pedagogical model), students’ internal state is the key predictor of their course performance. © 2021 The Authors</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Schöbel2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Two decades of game concepts in digital learning environments – A bibliometric study and research agenda</div> <div class="author"> Sofia Schöbel, Mohammed Saqr, and Andreas Janson </div> <div class="periodical"> 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> All Open Access, Hybrid Gold Open Access </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104296" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In recent years, using game concepts for educational purposes in digital environments has become continually more popular and relevant. Games can be used to motivate and engage users in regular system use and, in the end, support learners in achieving better learning outcomes. In this context, different kinds of game concepts exist, such as gamification or serious games, each with a different perspective and usefulness in digital learning environments. Because developing and using with game concepts in digital learning environments has recently become more important, and developing them is still not fully established, questions arise about future research directions involving games in digital learning. Therefore, this study aims to identify the state of the field and determine what is relevant when using game concepts in digital learning. To achieve this goal, we present the results of a bibliometric analysis considering more than 10,000 articles between 2000 and 2019 and summarize them to develop a research agenda. This agenda supports researchers and practitioners in identifying avenues for future research. We contribute to theory by providing a detailed understanding of the relevance of game concepts in digital learning. We propose a research agenda to assist researchers in planning future approaches with and about gamification concepts in digital learning. Practical implications are proposed by demonstrating what should be considered when using game concepts in learning environments. © 2021 The Authors</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6D%6F%68%61%6D%6D%65%64.%73%61%71%72@%75%65%66.%66%69" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1010907" title="Inspire HEP" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-inspire"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esaqr" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5881-3109" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed-Saqr/" title="ResearchGate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U-O6R7YAAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mohsaqr" title="X" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note">If you have a research idea, want to collaborate, are thinking of a funding proposal, or a PhD or master supervision, you are welcome to connect with me.
